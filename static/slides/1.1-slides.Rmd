# What Is This Class About?

.pull-left[

- This is not a class “about” the law (or a law class)

- I am not a lawyer...though I am happily married to one

- This is a class about how to *think* about the law, using economics
  - Economics is a set of tools, not a bunch of facts or topics

- Using microeconomic tools to analyze laws and legal systems:
  - the incentives they create
  - the choices and outcomes they lead to

> “You live in a state where the most severe criminal punishment is life imprisonment. Someone proposes that since armed robbery is a very serious crime, armed robbers should get a life sentence. A constitutional lawyer asks whether that is consistent with the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A legal philosopher asks whether it is just.”

> “An economist points out that if the punishments for armed robbery and for armed robbery plus murder are the same, the additional punishment for the murder is zero—and asks whether you really want to make it in the interest of robbers to murder their victims.” (p.8)

# Thinking Like a Lawyer vs. Thinking Like an Economist

- Suppose something has happened

- Lawyer — damage is *already* done, what to do:
  - assign blame
  - maybe punish someone
  - maybe compensate

- Not interesting to economists!

---

# Thinking Like a Lawyer vs. Thinking Like an Economist

- **Before** the incident, lots of **decisions** were made

- These were made based on **expectations** about what will happen

- These decisions affect the **outcomes** and **how much value is created and destroyed** by society

# Outline and Areas of Law

.pull-left[

1. Property Law
  - how do we establish who is entitled to what?
2. Contract Law
  - how do individuals permit use or exchange of entitlements?
3. Tort Law
  - how do we remedy violations of persons or entitlements?
4. Criminal Law
  - how does *the State* remedy *egregious* harms to *society*?

# Logistics: Hybrid Course

- We will have .hi-purple[synchronous] sessions Mon/Wed 2:00-3:15 PM on **<i class="fas fa-video"></i> Zoom**

- Lecture videos will be posted on **Blackboard** via Panopto for students unable to join synchronously
  - If you were present, you do not need to watch the video (again)!
  - You are not *required* to attend synchronously, but it will help you

- All graded assignments are .hi-turquoise[asynchronous]
  - (Probably) submitted on Blackboard by 11:59 PM Sundays
  - (Probably) timed exams on Blackboard

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. Grapple with the conflicting social goals of justice and efficiency

2. Derive the economic functions of key concepts, legal maxims, and rules in the substantive areas of law: torts, property, contracts, and criminal law

3. Apply economic models to determine the efficiency of legal rules

4. Identify the sources of law in the United States: common law jurisprudence, legislative statutes, administrative law

5. Identify the key legal institutions of the United States: state vs. federal courts, the appellate court system, state and federal constitutions, regulatory agencies, arbitration
