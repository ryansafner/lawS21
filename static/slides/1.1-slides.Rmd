# What Is This Class About?

.pull-left[

- This is not a class “about” the law (or a law class)

- This is a class about how to *think* about the law, using economics
  - Economics is a set of tools, not a bunch of facts or topics

# Thinking Like a Lawyer vs. Thinking Like an Economist

- Suppose something has happened

- Lawyer — damage is *already* done, what to do:
  - assign blame
  - maybe punish someone
  - maybe compensate

- Not interesting to economists!

---

# Thinking Like a Lawyer vs. Thinking Like an Economist

- **Before** the incident, lots of **decisions** were made

- These were made based on **expectations** about what will happen

- These decisions affect the **outcomes** and **how much value is created and destroyed** by society

# Outline and Areas of Law

.pull-left[

1. Property Law
  - how do we establish who is entitled to what?
2. Contract Law
  - how do individuals permit use or exchange of entitlements?
3. Tort Law
  - how do we remedy violations of persons or entitlements?
4. Criminal Law
  - how does *the State* remedy *egregious* harms to *society*?

3. Apply economic models to determine the efficiency of legal rules

4. Identify the sources of law in the United States: common law jurisprudence, legislative statutes, administrative law
