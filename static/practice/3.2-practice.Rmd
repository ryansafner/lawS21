The supply and demand in the market for tomatoes are estimated to be:
$$\begin{aligned}
q_D&=1000-200p\\
q_S&=200p-200\\ \end{aligned}$$

### 1. Calculate the market-clearing price and quantity exchanged.

### 2. Find the inverse demand function and inverse supply function.

### 3. Sketch a graph of this market, labelling key points.

### 4. Calculate the price elasticty of demand and price elasticity of supply (in equilibrium).

### 5. Calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus, and shade each on the graph.

### 6. Who gets greater surplus, consumers or producers, and why?
