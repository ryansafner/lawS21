The demand for monthly cell phone plans is given by:

$$q_D =  50-0.5p$$

### 1. Write the *inverse* demand function.

### 2. Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $10. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?

#### 3. Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $70. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?

#### 4. At what price is demand unit elastic $(\epsilon=-1)$?

#### 5. Calculate the total revenue at $10.

#### 6. Calculate the total revenue at $70.

#### 7. Calculate the total revenue at the price you found for question 4.
