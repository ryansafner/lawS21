A firm has short-run costs given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
C(q)&=q^2+1\\
MC(q)&=2q\\ \end{aligned}$$

### 1. Write an equation for fixed costs, $f$.

### 2. Write an equation for variable costs, $VC(q)$.

### 3. Write an equation for average fixed costs, $AFC(q)$.

### 4. Write an equation for average variable costs, $AVC(q)$.

### 5. Write an equation for average (total) costs, $AC(q)$.

### 6. Suppose the firm is in a competitive market, and the current market price is $4, how many units of output maximize profits?

### 7. How much profit will this firm earn?

### 8. At what market price would the firm break even $(\pi=0)$?

### 9. Below what market price would the firm shut down in the short run if it were earning losses?

### 10. Write out the firm's short run supply function.
